# EulerTotientFormula

I completed this project for a class titled Foundations of Discrete Mathematics at Colorado College. It was part of my 
final project regarding the Euler Totient Function. It is an implementation of the Euler Totient Formula with a recursive 
subroutine to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers. This was a fun project to complete. Because of the size, I did not 
put too much thought into Big O complexity or scalability.
